<h2 font-family: "Quattrocento Sans"; style="text-align:center;">The Construction Sector in New Anglia</h2>

<p style="text-align:center;">The construction sector is a major component of New Anglia’s economy, accounting for £2.4bn of GVA1 and with a workforce of over 59,000 - many of whom are working outside of Norfolk and Suffolk. There are around 7,370 construction businesses with the overwhelming majority (93%) being micro sized companies with less than 10 employees. It provides a greater proportion of our GVA (over 7%) than the industry provides on average in other LEP areas making it integral to the health and growth of Norfolk & Suffolk’s economy.</p>

<h2>The Section Skills Plan</h2>

<p> This Sector Skills Plan (SSP) is an industry-led document developed by the Building Growth Group in partnership with, industry bodies, training providers and local authorities. It provides a framework for aligning public and private sector investment in skills through mainstream funding and locally delivered initiatives such as the New Anglia Skills Deals Programme and Skills Support for the Workforce. It aims to highlight the skills priorities that need to be addressed to support the sector’s growth ambitions and the LEP’s Strategic Economic Plan to build 117,000 new houses, create 95,000 more jobs and 10,000 new businesses by 2026.</p>
<h3>To help to address the key challenges identified above the following actions have been agreed against three main priorities:</h3>
<h4>Provision – Training provision to match forecast need</h4> 
<p>•	We will pilot, develop, and establish a work experience brokerage scheme</p>
<p>•	We will create and promote a New Anglia Construction Training Fund</p>
<p>•	We will establish an effective mechanism to identify and address specific skills gaps in the sector</p>
<p>•	We will develop, pilot, and establish a programme of pre-employment skills training designed to enhance reskilling and conversion pathways into construction.</p>
<h4>Perception and Inspiration - Enhance sector image to increase volume and diversity</h4>
<p>•	We will conduct an audit of existing communication and look to identify key messages to be used consistently across organisations and platforms</p>
<p>•	We will place the construction sector at the forefront of the New Anglia Youth Pledge</p>
<h4>Meeting Demand – Plan to address the forecast growth in labour demand</h4>
<p>•	We will establish a Building Growth Nuclear Forum to understand the wider impact of Sizewell C on all planned construction projects.</p>
